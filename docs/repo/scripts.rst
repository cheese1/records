Download
--------

Git clone to local, add the absolute path to ``PATH``. Then use the ``.bat`` commands everywhere.



Homestead
---------

Add the homestead directory's absolute path to the name ``homesteadVagrant`` in system environment variables.

Then, use the command ``homestead`` as ``vagrant``, for example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ homestead -up

    $ homestead reload --provision

    $ homestead halt
